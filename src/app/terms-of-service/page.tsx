      <h2>5. Registration and Account Security</h2>
      <h3>5.1 Account Creation</h3>
      <p>
        To access certain features of the Services, you must register for an Account. During registration, you will be required to provide accurate and complete information (including a valid email address). You agree to keep your Account credentials
        confidential and not share them with others. You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your Account.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2 Authorized Users</h3>
      <p>
        You may designate Authorized Users to use the Services on your behalf. You are responsible for any actions taken by your Authorized Users and must ensure they comply with these Terms. You may add or remove Authorized Users via your Account
        settings; however, Subscription Fees are calculated on a per-Seat or per-User basis as described in Section 6.
      </p>

      <h3>5.3 Account Security</h3>
      <p>
        Notify us immediately if you learn of any unauthorized use of your Account or if your credentials are compromised. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Account if we suspect unauthorized access, fraudulent activities, or a violation of
        these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Subscription Plans, Fees, and Payment</h2>
      <h3>6.1 Subscription Plans</h3>
      <p>
        Our Services are offered under various Subscription Plans (e.g., Free, Basic, Pro, Enterprise). Each plan includes specific features, usage limits, and pricing. Plan details (feature sets, usage caps) are accessible on our website or dashboard. We
        reserve the right to modify plan offerings or pricing at any time, provided that existing Subscribers receive at least 30 days’ advance notice before changes take effect.
      </p>

      <h3>6.2 Billing and Payment</h3>
      <p>
        You agree to pay all Subscription Fees associated with your chosen plan in accordance with the applicable billing cycle (monthly, annually, or as otherwise indicated). All fees are quoted in [Currency] and are exclusive of taxes (e.g., VAT, GST).
        You are responsible for paying any applicable taxes unless you provide a valid tax-exemption certificate. We use third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle credit card and ACH transactions. By providing payment information,
        you authorize us and our payment processors to charge your designated payment method for Subscription Fees and any applicable taxes. You must keep your payment information up to date. If a payment fails (e.g., credit card expiration), we will
        notify you by email. If payment is not received within fourteen (14) days after the due date, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services until payment is made in full.
      </p>

      <h3>6.3 Free Trials</h3>
      <p>
        If you enroll in a free trial, you will have limited access to the Services for a specified period (e.g., 14 or 30 days). You must provide valid payment information to start the trial. If you do not cancel before the trial period ends, we will
        automatically charge you the subscription fee for the plan you selected, as outlined during signup. You may cancel at any time during the trial to avoid charges.
      </p>

      <h3>6.4 Upgrades, Downgrades, and Add-Ons</h3>
      <p>
        You may upgrade or downgrade your Subscription Plan at any time. Upgrades (e.g., moving from Basic to Pro) take effect immediately, and you will be charged a prorated amount for the remainder of the current billing cycle. Downgrades (e.g., from Pro
        to Basic) will take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. If your usage exceeds the limits of your new plan before that time, you may be required to upgrade again or pay overage fees. Add-On services (e.g., additional storage, extra API
        calls) are billed separately according to the pricing published on our website.
      </p>

      <h3>6.5 Refunds and Cancellations</h3>

      <h2>11. Confidentiality</h2>
      <h3>11.1 Definition</h3>
      <p>
        “Confidential Information” means any non-public, proprietary information disclosed by one party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other (“Receiving Party”) in connection with these Terms, whether oral or written, that is designated as confidential or
        that should reasonably be understood to be confidential given its nature and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, technical data, trade secrets, know-how, business strategies, pricing, and
        customer information.
      </p>

      <h3>11.2 Obligations</h3>
      <p>
        The Receiving Party shall use Confidential Information solely to perform its obligations under these Terms and disclose it only to its employees, contractors, or agents who need to know such information for those purposes and are bound by confidentiality
        obligations no less strict than those set forth herein. The Receiving Party shall protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event less
        than reasonable care. Confidential Information does not include information that:

      <ul>
        <li>Is or becomes publicly available without breach of these Terms;</li>
        <li>Was in the Receiving Party’s possession before receipt from the Disclosing Party;</li>

        <li>Is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>11.3 Compelled Disclosure</h3>
      <p>
        If the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose any Confidential Information (e.g., subpoena, court order), it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other
        appropriate remedy. The Receiving Party will provide reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party’s expense, in obtaining such remedy.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Disclaimers</h2>
      <h3>12.1 “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”</h3>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS
